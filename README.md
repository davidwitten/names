# Names
Since 1910, the Social Security Administration has published a record of people born in each state by year and gender. I provide tools to analyze this data, including measuring the geographical variation and change in popularity over time.

Database
--
The total database is 150 MB in size. Because of this, it is too large to upload to Github. I am creating a condensed version of the database which only includes the top 2000 names or so (as opposed to 30000).
